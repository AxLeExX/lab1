    <p>Alex Schroeder served a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Lima, Peru.
      While there, he became fluent in Spanish, became acquainted with the local culture, and made lasting friendships with the people he met.
      However, in his opinion, the greatest blessings were getting closer to God and becoming a better person.
      <br/><br/>"I am so grateful I was able to serve the Lord by teaching others about his gospel and helping them get to know him better," Alex says.
      "It's a unique experience that has caused me to grow so much. Not only has it helped me appreciate just how valuable it all is to me,
      it has also changed many aspects of who I was to make me who I now am."
      <br/><br/>Alex hopes that, by sharing some of the memories from his time in Peru, he can help others understand what missionaries are:
      young men and women attempting to share something so precious to them with others.
